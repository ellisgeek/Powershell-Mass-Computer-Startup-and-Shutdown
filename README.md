# startstop.ps1
Batch startup and shutdown for windows based computer labs.

## Configuration
At the moment the only configuration needed is to populate a file called `Computers.csv` with a list of the "PODS" (groups of computers) that you want to be able to start and stop. An example Computers.csv is included in this repository.

## Usage
The script expects `Computers.csv` to exist in the same folder as the script.
